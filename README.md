#Thyroid Data Science Project
#Project goals
This project is for anyone who wants to apply algorithms learned in machine learning to get rid of the theoretical part. I'm using a thyroid dataset to use a machine learning algorithm to determine if someone is hypo (lower TSH percentage) or hyper (higher TSH percentage).
Steps I'm doing:
1 - Download CSV file from Kagglee
2-Upload to Jupiter Notebook
3-Start by understanding the data
4-Data Cleaning and Visualization
5-Apply feature reduction
6- Apply some machine learning algorithms such as: B. Nieve Basics, Decision Tree, Knn.
7- Apply basic deep learning models using neural networks
8- Compare accuracy between algorithms using confusion matrix and ROC
