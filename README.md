Thyroid Data Science Project
Project Overview:
This data science project aims to apply machine learning algorithms to a thyroid dataset in order to predict whether an individual is hypo or hyper based on the TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) percentage. The primary goal is to move beyond theoretical knowledge and gain practical experience in implementing machine learning techniques.

Project Steps:
Download CSV file from Kaggle:

Obtain the thyroid dataset from Kaggle, which will serve as the primary source for this project.
Upload to Jupyter Notebook:

Utilize Jupyter Notebook as the development environment for the project. Upload the downloaded CSV file to begin the analysis.
Understanding the Data:

Explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into its structure, features, and characteristics.
Data Cleaning and Visualization:

Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, or any inconsistencies. Visualize key aspects of the data to better understand patterns and trends.
Apply Feature Reduction:

Implement techniques for feature reduction to select the most relevant features that contribute to the prediction model.
Apply Machine Learning Algorithms:

Utilize various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to build predictive models.
Apply Basic Deep Learning Models:

Implement basic deep learning models using neural networks to explore their effectiveness in predicting thyroid conditions.
Compare Accuracy:

Evaluate the performance of different algorithms by comparing accuracy metrics. Use confusion matrix and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis to assess the models' effectiveness.
Running the Project:

Dependencies:
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning.
